This is a client-server multiplayer blackjack card game. Players can join new tables created by the server through the client, which serves as the house. Each player has a starting bankroll and is required to wager a minimum amount each round. After every round, players have the option to leave, or they will be eliminated if they do not have enough money to put the minimum wager. Dealer strikes with a soft 17. Standard Blackjack rules apply to all other regulations.
