# Blackjack

This is a multiplayer Blackjack card game with a server and client. The server acts as the house and creates new tables for players to join through the client. Every player starts with a certain amount of money and must place a minimum bet each round. Players can leave after each round or will be kicked out when they do not have enough money to place the minimum bet. The dealer hits on a soft 17. All other rules are standard Blackjack rules.
