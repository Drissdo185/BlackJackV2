# Blackjack

This is a client-server multiplayer blackjack card game. Players can join new tables created by the server through the client, which serves as the house. Each player has a starting bankroll and is required to wager a minimum amount each round. After every round, players have the option to leave, or they will be eliminated if they do not have enough money to put the minimum wager. Dealer strikes with a soft 17. Standard Blackjack rules apply to all other regulations.

## How to Play

Here are the guidelines for playing blackjack. It can be played either way: multiplayer by using the server address option below to run the server on one computer and clients on other computers, or singleplayer by running the server and client on the same machine.

## Goal

Have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.
